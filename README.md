## 📦 About <a name = "about"></a>

Captain manages multiple `agent` with a `mission`.

Python files under the `agents` folder are executed concurrently, like a framework with plugins would.

This framework is designed for rapid usage (KISS). In a few minutes, you can have your first *agent* ready.

By default, Captain uses file as input argument. Head to the [documentation](https://itskovacs.github.io/captain) to adapt Captain to your needs, for instance to use strings as input or even eliminate the need for input.

> [!TIP]  
You can customize *agents* with *metadata*.  
For instance, if your *agent* should only do its *mission* on a specific file type (e.g. Binary, Image, Archive, etc.), you can specify it and it will be automatic.

## 🌱 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Clone the repo, install the sources and head to the [documentation](https://itskovacs.github.io/captain) to get started create and use your first agent. 

```bash
  # Clone repository
  git clone https://github.com/itskovacs/Captain.git
  cd Captain

  # Activate virtual environment
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate

  # Install dependencies
  pip install -e . # Use '-e' for dev mode
```

## 💡 Use Cases <a name = "usecases"></a>

Captain is a versatile framework that enables you to create a variety of Python scripts and run them concurrently on various inputs such as files, links, words, or any other data according to your specific needs. You can as well eliminate the requirement of input. It's up to you.

For instance, you can:
- Run multiple Python scripts (parsers, tools, etc.) on a file,
- Launch specific tools on a file based on its type,
- Query different services to retrieve information related to a specific string input,
- Parse multiple websites and RSS feeds, no input needed

> [!IMPORTANT]  
Unlike an assembly line that runs sequentially, Captain's *agents* run concurrently.

> [!TIP]  
Captain's uses threads (by default) to concurrently run *agents*. You can also use process-based execution, see [documentation](https://itskovacs.github.io/captain) about Threads/Processes.

## 📸 Demo <a name = "demo"></a>
With minimal customization, you can execute your *agents* on a file, automatically selecting the *agents* capable of parsing that type of file and output the results generated by *agents* in files.
